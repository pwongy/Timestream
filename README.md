## About
Timestream is an Android app for recording **irregularly recurring events**, often of low priority and without strict deadlines. We humans tend to forget these easily. Timestream helps users keep track of these events and provides reminders when they should be done again.

Example use cases include:

- Logging check-ups with your doctor/dentist (e.g. blood tests)

**Habits**
- Developing new routines (e.g. fasting, meditating)
- Tracking sobriety (e.g. avoiding social media)
- Building vocabulary for a foreign language

**Social**
- Calling your mum/dad
- Buying flowers for your girlfriend
- Meeting a stranger

**Maintenance**
- Replacing your Britta filter
- Starting a new toothbrush/razor blade/contact lenses
- Performing digital maintenance (updating passwords for online accounts, clearing cookies/internet cache)
- Noting warranty expirations
